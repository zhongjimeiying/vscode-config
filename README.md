## This repo contains my vs code [extensions, keyboard-shortkeys, settings]

I use Python as my universal program language, and mainly config is about it.
It also has some extensions about Vue, I want to learn it.
I found a good snippet to generate interpolation-expression like { some word } by [ie]
VS Code is a very nice editor, I found many good extensions, and can do most things without mouse.
